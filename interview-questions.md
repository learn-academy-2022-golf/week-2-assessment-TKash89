# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: The difference between a parameter and an argument? It's easy to get these two confused. I know that the parameter, signified with two parentheses, is the "open door" for data. The argument, is the data that is passed through the "door". In a funtion, both of these are found after the variable is declared, and before the function arrows.

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable that is within a function. An argument is the data that would be passed into the parameter. This happens when a method is called, passing the "argument into the method's "parameter". Parameters are also defined in the function declaration, and are only available with the function. Arguments are what are given to the function when they are called on or executed. Arguments are also called "Actual Parameters". Parameters can also be called "Formal Parameters".



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer:   I don't have as much experience using the .map() built in method. I do understand that this is a High Order Function, and that is cuts down the amount of code you normally would have to write. This particular method in Javascript gives you an output of the same length array.

Researched answer: The High Order Function .map() is beneficial because it calls a function for every element in an array. It doesn't change the original array. The .map() method is able to perform iteration over objects and key-value pairs.   The predefined parameters when using .map() are value (the value of the element), index(index or place of the element), and Array or arr(contains the array itself.) The first predefined parameter, value, is required. The index and arr parameters are not required and are optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?   

Your answer:  The big difference between map and filter in Javascript is that map creates a new array with the same number of elements, where as filter creates a new array but with a shorter array as an output. 

Researched answer: Map applies a function for every array element, creating a new array, while filter returns a very specific value for every element. Map does not discard any of the elements, depending on the function, it iterates and changes the value of the elements. The results are a new array with the same length as the previous one. Filter, based on the conditions, will return a new array discarding any elements that do not meet the expected criteria, resulting in an array that has less elements. This is the biggest difference between the high order functions Map and Filter.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the process of doing something over, and over until a condition is met. In javascript, the for loops comes to mind immediately. This code is a great example of what iteration looks like. A for loop is able to iterate, or, cycle through arrays until a condition is met. So far, I have done some basic for loops for things such as: Writing a function to find the even numbers in an array, or finding the highest number value. 

Researched answer: Iteration performs a repetitive task, looping through an array. Iteration, in particular for loops, are useful when a function needs to be executed a given number of times through an array. Not only are there different loops : (for, for/in, While, do/while), the higher order functions of Map and Filter iterate through javascript arrays as well.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: I can explain the difference between a class and an object in not-so-technical terms: A class acts like a blueprint for and object. Even though they both may be defined as the same thing or close to it. A class provides instructions for the object. The object is the crossroads between data and behavior that lives within the class. 

Researched answer: The class acts just like a blueprint for the object. Every object is an instance of the class, within. With no objects, the class has no attached memory or data. it takes the creation of the objects in order to use variables and methods. With as many objects you can have in a class, only one class can be declared. Objects are different from a class because objects can be manipulated, where as a class cannot.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Honestly, this is a term I have not heard of or learned about. I can find you the right answer if you'd like.

Researched answer: Hoisting makes it possible in javascript to move all the declarations to the top of the scope, before the execution of the code. This allows the user to call functions before they are written in the code. This movement is also regardless if the scope is global or local.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: This is a technique writing stories in the the first person that are short, from a user's perspective.

2. Spread operator: These allow and array or string to be expanded apart where arguments are expected to be placed. The syntax uses periods within closed parenthesis

3. React: React is a javascript library that contatins tools to build a one page application and user interface.

4. React props: This stands for properties, and these are the arguments that are passed into the React components. This is where the value attributes of tags are stored, creating a seamless back and forth for data in React.

5. DOM events: A DOM event stands for document object model, and in particular, an event allows event handlers on elements in an HTML document to register in Javascript.
